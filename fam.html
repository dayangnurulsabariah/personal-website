        <p><strong>Family:</strong>My family is my source of strength and motivation to keep going until today especially my parents, Mama and Abah. As they grow older, my biggest hope is to repay all their sacrifices first. I was born into a modest but sufficient family, where I was blessed with religious upbringing and education. Alhamdulillah, whether it came through their guidance or my own efforts.</p>

        <p><strong>School friends:</strong> My circle of friends kept changing from primary to secondary school, but everything changed in Form 4 when I accidentally ended up sitting next to these four classmates. We had known each other since primary school but weren’t close at all. It wasn’t until Form 4 that we really bonded, and we’ve stayed tight ever since. They may not be my oldest friends, but they’re definitely the ones who stood by me when I was at my lowest, worrying about what’s next. What can i say is they are my bestfriends till now.</p>
        
        <br><br>
        <p><strong>Diploma friends:</strong> Actually, I have other diploma friends too, but my roommates were the first ones I met and like they say, first impressions count! I came all alone from Sabah without knowing anyone to study with, and they were the first people I met and got close to at UiTM Kedah during my diploma journey. For me, the first will always be the winner, and those memories will always stay. They have become one of the best parts of my life.</p>
