            <p>Hello! I’m Dayang, a student currently pursuing my Diploma Library Infromatics Science in UITM Kedah, Campus Sungai Petani. I come from the beautiful state of Sabah. Growing up, I never imagined I’d study so far from home. But I made this decision for my parents and me also, because they are my everything. They’ve supported me in ways I can’t express, and this journey is my way of showing my gratitude.</p>

            <h2>Challenges & Growth</h2>
            <p>It’s not always easy being away from family, especially when you're in a completely new place, far from home, alone. There are times when I feel the weight of being away, and the challenges of adapting to a new environment, new culture, friend and adapt with the various situations. But this has been one of the most important stages of my life to grow. Being away from home and navigating adulthood isn’t simple as we think before. There are days when it’s tiring, but I remind myself that <strong>life must go on</strong>. The struggles are part of the process, it help us to guide our personal growth.</p>

            <h2>My Personality</h2>
            <p>As an introvert, I tend to enjoy moments of solitude to recharge, but I also value the deep, meaningful conversations with the few close friends I’ve made here. It’s a balance learning to be comfortable with myself while also connecting with others when needed. I am the person that may take time to open up, but once i do, i value connections that are sincere and lasting.</p>

            <h2>Life Philosophy</h2>
            <p>I believe that life is about finding balance. It’s about pushing through the tough times, growing through the struggles, and appreciating the small wins. What matters most to me is that I’m always learning and evolving. Kindness, persistence, and gratitude are at the core of who I am. Even though it’s hard, I still want to try because same just like healing and acception may takes time.</p>

            <h2>My Dreams</h2>
            <p>Looking ahead, I hope to continue my education and eventually build a career that allows me to make a positive impact, maybe as a librarian or out of my learning course because we don't know the future path, it can change easily by in each situation taken, so just follow the flow. Others, I have been dream of helping others, whether through my work or personal actions, and I hope that I can one day return the love and sacrifices my parents have made for me.</p>

            <h2>Fun Facts About Me</h2>
            <p>Outside of my studies, I love reading, gaming, and sometimes even writing in my free time. I’m a person who values calm, reflective moments but also enjoys the thrill of a good game or a good book. But now, I just want to get my spark back again to feel excited and motivated like before to do and enjoy to do my all hobbies.</p>
